## Firepit inbox

At the start of a session, read any pending messages in `.firepit/inbox/*.md` — cross-project notes Firepit routes here. Act on each, then mark it done with the `firepit_inbox_complete` MCP tool, passing the message's filename as the `id`.

## Firepit knowledge

Before researching something that may already be known, query the knowledge base with the `firepit_knowledge_search` MCP tool (scope `both` covers this project plus the global base). Save durable findings with `firepit_knowledge_add` — written in English, per the indexing convention. The created markdown files live under `.firepit/knowledge/` and are committed like any other file.

## Firepit pinned knowledge

@.firepit/knowledge-pinned.md

The import above auto-loads the knowledge docs marked `pin: true` in their frontmatter — always-on rules that apply every session without a search. Firepit regenerates the file from the pinned docs; don't edit it directly. Pin/unpin via the pinned flag on `firepit_knowledge_add` / `firepit_knowledge_update`, and keep the pinned set small — everything else stays reachable through `firepit_knowledge_search`.

## Firepit artifacts

When you produce a file the user will want to open — a report, screenshot, diagram, generated image, log excerpt, build output, or an executable you built for them to run — pin it with the `firepit_artifact_add` MCP tool so it appears in the project's paperclip pane. Do this as you produce it, not at the end of the session; a path buried in scrollback is a path the user has to hunt for. Pinning only links the file — it stays where it is, and `firepit_artifact_remove` never deletes it. Check `firepit_artifact_list` first so you update an existing entry instead of piling up near-duplicates, and unpin what has gone stale.

## Firepit conventions

<!-- claude-firepit-fragments -->

@../.firepit/projects/claude.md
@../.firepit/projects/claude-github-public.md

The two imports above are shared files in the Firepit central repo — edit them there and every project follows. They carry policy; the tools themselves are described by Firepit's MCP server at the handshake, so nothing is duplicated between the two.
